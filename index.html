        phew... damn. i really want this grl. and it's not about her face or body and especially not because i'm lonely or sad. it's because i wanna show this girl that she's worth something. that she's worth everything. i wanna show her what true love is. to make her feel special. i wanna spend time together laughing, and making memories, growing together and helping each other learn about life. i wanna go through tough times together. i want her to have someone that feels like home. i want her to feel safe, and i want her to know that she deserves a love that will last. it hurts to see her hurt, and that's why i'd give her my loyalty
